Prompt Used:

    "=[@Quantity]*[@UnitPrice] syntax is not correct"
    "I want to calculate Total Sales for each row in Excel using Quantity and UnitPrice columns."

AI Response:

To fix the formula and calculate total sales row-wise, use this instead:
=Quantity * UnitPrice

If you're using an Excel table with structured references, try:
=[@Quantity]*[@UnitPrice]
Make sure both columns have valid numeric data and no blank cells. You can then drag the formula down or let Excel auto-fill.

Reflection:

What did the AI do well?
The AI quickly identified the correct formula, explained why the error might occur, and gave structured reference and regular syntax versions, which was very helpful.

What did I have to improve?
I had to ensure the table format was applied in Excel, as the formula only works correctly within an Excel Table. I also had to manually verify that the column headers matched the field names exactly.
