## ✅ Section 1: Python + Machine Learning

- **Dataset**: Student Performance
- **Goal**: Predict whether a student passes or fails based on scores and demographics
- **Tech Stack**: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, SMOTE

### Key Highlights:
- Performed detailed EDA including correlation heatmaps, KDE, and boxplots.
- Engineered a binary `result` column based on subject thresholds.
- Built and evaluated both Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers.
- Handled class imbalance using SMOTE and re-trained models.
- Visualized pre- and post-SMOTE distributions.
- Documented insights and explained model decisions.

## ✅ Section 4: Excel – Online Retail Dataset (UCI)

- **Tool Used**: Microsoft Excel

### Tasks Completed:
- Cleaned dataset (removed nulls & duplicates)
- Created a **pivot table** to show sales by country & month
- Used formulas for:
  - Average Order Value = `=TotalSales / OrderCount`
  - Country % contribution
- Conditional formatting to highlight **top 5 countries**
- Line chart for monthly revenue trend

## ✅ Section 5: Bonus – Teaching Philosophy

> “As a TA, I’d support students struggling with concepts or deadlines through one-on-one guidance, creating small achievable checkpoints, and offering real-world analogies for complex topics.”

### Example: Explaining Gradient Descent
> “I compare it to rolling a ball down a hill — taking small steps in the direction of the steepest slope until we reach the lowest point. This intuitive visual, followed by gradual math, ensures conceptual clarity.”

## ✅ Section 6: AI Tools & LLMs

- **Tool Used**: ChatGPT
- **Prompt Example**:
  > "Write a SQL query to list the top 5 customers by purchase amount from the Chinook database."
- **Outcome**: Helpful base logic, tweaked for custom JOINs.
- **Reflection**: Accelerated productivity and enabled rapid ideation.
